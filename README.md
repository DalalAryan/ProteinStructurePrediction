# Protein Structure Naive Bayes Classifier Prediction Model
This is a 'Protein Structure Prediction Model' as part of UCLA Math 156: Machine Learning Fall 2025 Final Project. Our model is a collaborative project with fellow team members: Andrew Zhang, Steven Villanueva, and Jiwoo Hyun. We have developed a Naive Bayes Classifier Model to predict Protein Structure from protein sequences.
